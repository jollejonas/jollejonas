# Hi there, I'm Jonas 👋  
### Software developer with a passion for learning, fullstack projects and building useful tools

I've always been curious about programming – I started dabbling in it during primary school.  
After training and working in plastics manufacturing (including at LEGO), I realized my real calling was building **digital tools** rather than physical ones.

---

## 💡 What drives me
- I'm motivated by learning and experimenting
- I love building real things that people actually need
- I'm curious by nature – and there's always something new to explore in tech

---

## 💻 What I enjoy working with
- Fullstack development (React + .NET)
- Databases and backend structure
- AI and prompt engineering
- Clean code and smart architecture
- Hosting, CI/CD and Azure DevOps

---

## 🔨 Projects I'm proud of

### [🧠 BodyLog](https://github.com/jollejonas/BodyLog)  
A full-featured measurement and weight tracking web app, built from scratch with:
- User authentication (JWT)
- .NET Web API and SQL Server
- React frontend with charting and local storage
- Azure backend + Vercel frontend deployment
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD  

It's my most complete project so far – and I'm continuing to build on it.

## 🚀 I'm currently working on
- Improving the UI and polish of BodyLog
- Learning more about backend architecture and security
- Becoming better at design to grow as a fullstack developer

---

## 🧠 What I'm like as a developer

- Persistent and motivated to do things right
- I’ll search the internet endlessly to fix a bug or learn something new
- I enjoy learning best practices – and using them!
- I prefer small teams and meaningful projects where I can make a difference
